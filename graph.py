    This function greedily searches for an optimal elimination order.

    Find an order in which to eliminate nodes from the graph in such a way
    as to try and minimize the weight of the resulting triangulated graph.
    The weight of a graph is the sum of the weights of each of its cliques;
    the weight of a clique is the product of the weights of each of its
    members; the weight of a node is the number of values it can take on.

    Since this is an NP-hard problem, we use the following greedy heuristic:
    At each step, eliminate that node which will result in the addition of
    the least number of fill-in edges, breaking ties by choosing the node
    that induces the lighest clique.

def cliques_to_jtree(cliques, ns):
    """
    This function produces an optimal junction tree from a set of cliques.

    A junction tree is a tree that satisfies the jtree property, which says:
    for each pair of cliques U, V with intersection S, all cliques on the
    path between U and V contain S. (This ensures that local propagation
    leads to global consistency.)

    The best jtree is the maximal spanning tree which minimizes the sum of
    the costs on each edge. The cost on an edge connecting cliques i and j,
    is the weight of the seperator set between the two cliques, defined as
    the intersection between cliques i and j.

    Therefore, to determine the cost of an edge connecting 2 cliques:
    C[i] = clique i, and
    C[j] = clique j,
    S[i, j] = Intersection(C[i], C[j]), is the seperator set between i
    and j,
    w[S[i, j]]= weight of the seperator set, which is the product of the
    weights of each node in S, where the weight of a node is the number of
    values that node can take on. Therefore the cost of an edge connecting
    clique i and clique j is: cost[i, j] = W[S[i, j]].
